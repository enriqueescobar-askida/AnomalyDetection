R Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection has various applications.
Ranging from fraud detection to anomalous aircraft engine and medical device detection.
In this blog post, I used anomaly detection algorithm, in order to detect
outliers of servers in a network using multivariate normal model.
The data is from the famous Machine Learning Coursera Course by Andrew Ng.
The lab exercises in that course are in Octave/Matlab.
I am planning to do all the programming exercises in that course with R and I have started with anomaly detection.
